# DuyismBot

Originated from the [GiveMeBadge bot by AlexFlipnote](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/GiveMeBadge) (he is still honored in the LICENSE, check it out!), this bot is my Python crash course.

To host your own instance of the bot, make sure you have cloned this repository, installed Python 3.8 or later and requirements mentioned in `requirements.txt`. If not, just run
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
in the repository tree.
(`giacpy` is an optional dependency, but currently has no support for Python 3.11.)
Then run
```
python3 index.py
```
to start the bot.
